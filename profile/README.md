# AxomicDevs: Boufin Personas

As a part of my profesional scholarship, I was tasked to develop a new module of an existing product. With my team, `Axomic!`, we managed to stablish a good starting point from the requirements, and put our hands to work to decide a marketing strategy, the designing of some financial reports, and more.

I took the part of developing a whole architecture for this problem, which can be overlooked on the following diagram:

However, the developing was made in a hurry of less than two weeks, so only the `Reports` module was made. To get that module working, check for more details on the Terraform's repo, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Axomic-dev/Report-Terraform).
